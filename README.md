# AudioEngineDemo
## Simple Swift/iOS audio recorder 

A stripped-down version of the [Apple sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/audio_track_engineering/using_voice_processing) demonstrating the use of voice processing with `AudioEngine`. All Apple audio files have been removed.

Works with iOS 12.4+ since all iOS 13 voice processing innovations have been removed.

Intended as a template for efficient Swift/iOS deployment of audio record and playback.
